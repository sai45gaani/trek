      <p>People say ‘History doesn’t repeat’, but we decided to repeat it.</p>

      <p>
        One won’t find as much drama in Bollywood movies as in the life of Shivaji.
        Agra escape, Afzalkhan’s murder, and escape from Panhala!
      </p>

      <p>
        Shivaji was under siege of Siddi Johar on Panhala fort. The siege lasted long
        and all food stocks had finished, and it made things difficult for Shivaji.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was impossible to defeat the 30000 soldiered troop of Siddi. Shivaji with
        some 600 mavalas decided to escape to Vishalgad, some 60 kms away.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was Ashadi Pournima, with heavy rains falling. Shivaji informed Siddi that
        he would surrender hence the Siddi troops were little careless.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking advantage Shivaji escaped from Panhala. He was not safe till he reached
        Vishalgad. It was some how that the Siddi’s troops spotted Shivaji escape.
      </p>

      <p>
        Siddi immediately sent horsed troops behind him and they got hold of Shivaji,
        who was later brought to Siddi’s camp.
      </p>

      <p>
        But it was Shivaji’s game plan; person whom they had caught was not Shivaji,
        but Siva Navi who was immediately killed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Siddi somehow came to know that Shivaji was on his way to Vishalgad, and so
        sent troops behind him.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shivaji knew that Siddi’s troops were following him. Baji Prabhu, Shivaji’s
        loyal sardar decided to stay in Ghod Khind with 300 mavalas.
      </p>

      <p>
        Baji with his 300 mavalas had guerilla warfare at Ghodkhind and held the Siddis
        troops there. They fought bravely till their death.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was only after Baji heard the canon fire indicating safe reach of Shivaji
        at Vishalgad, he gave his life.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was 21 hour continuous journey from Panhala to Vishalgad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Story didn’t end here; Shivaji had to fight his way to Vishalgad.
      </p>

      <p>
        Vishalgad is a fort difficult to conquer, difficult to lay siege. Also even if
        siege was laid, one would have enough time to escape to Konkan.
      </p>

      <p>
        Siddi was building siege on Vishalgad, but Shivaji with his diplomatic trick
        made Adil Shah bring back Siddi Johar.
      </p>

      <p>
        We were in all 7, including me, Sanjeev, Nitin, Mandar, Sadanad, Sagar and
        Prashant.
      </p>

      <p>
        We started on 26 night from Pune via Sahyadri express, alighted at Kolhapur,
        refreshed ourselves in a lodge.
      </p>

      <p>
        Taking darshan of Tulja Bhavani we left for Panhala. Panhala is one hour from
        Kolhapur by bus.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is less like a fort and more like a hill station. Buses take one right on
        the top of the fort.
      </p>

      <p>
        From here there are several places to be seen Siddeshwar temple, Vagha Darwaja,
        Ambarkhana, Teen Darvaja, Pusati Buruj, Rajdindi.
      </p>

      <p>
        We didn’t spend much time on Panhala as we knew we had to go a long way.
      </p>

      <p>
        From Panhala we descended by the Pusati Buruj to Turukwdi and climbed up the
        Mhasal Pathar.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is a long rock plateau of about 11 km, devoid of any vegetation or habitation
        except a solitary temple. Strong winds are its specialty.
      </p>

      <p>
        It was evening time when we reached up the Mahasal Plateau and had the view of
        the sunset.
      </p>

      <p>
        We lost our way here and ended up through spear headed grass to a place,
        Dhangarwadi.
      </p>

      <p>
        We had to do some night trek then to Kumbharwadi some 4 kms from there.
      </p>

      <p>
        We reached Kumbharwadi at 8 pm. We stayed with a villager, asked them to cook
        food for us and decided to sleep in their varanda.
      </p>

      <p>
        Food was peculiar Kolhapuri, HOT! Bhakari, Usal, Dal rice and milk…a royal
        dinner!
      </p>

      <p>
        Next day 29, we had to walk some 35 kms as per plan, hence we started early.
      </p>

      <p>
        From Kumbharwadi to Mandlawadi is 9 km walk along normal bullock cart track.
      </p>

      <p>
        From here we have to cross some mountain ridges and reach Patewadi.
      </p>

      <p>
        From Patewadi onwards we found unusual behaviour of children in the village.
      </p>

      <p>
        They used to ask us for sweets, may be they were used to trekkers giving them
        sweets.
      </p>

      <p>
        This behaviour leads to question in the mind that should we give children
        sweets in the village?
      </p>

      <p>
        It was evening when we reached Pandherpani. Mandar and Prashant were feeling
        the pain.
      </p>

      <p>
        Prashant was totally dehydrated accompanied with vomiting.
      </p>

      <p>
        We decided to stay in the school there and asked a villager to cook food for us.
      </p>

      <p>
        Star gazing, Nitin’s jyotishshastra, chilling night followed after the dinner.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our plan was totally disturbed. We hence booked a private jeep from Pandarpani
        which would take us to Vishalgad, Pavan Khind and back to Malkapur.
      </p>

      <p>
        Woke up at 4 am, cold and Khatmals didn’t allow us to sleep well.
      </p>

      <p>
        Jeep dropped us at the base of Vishalgad. It was then a climb of 15 minutes
        along the steps to reach the top.
      </p>

      <p>
        We visited Pavan Khind also known as Ghod Khind, where Baji Prabhu fought a
        lonely brave battle.
      </p>

      <p>
        Paying tributes to Shivaji, Baji Prabhu here we made our return trip.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, nice trek, new friends, lot of history learned, tested stamina and
        most important of all- loving nature’s proximity.
      </p>
