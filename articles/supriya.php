        Trekking- A wonderful experience for one who is interested to see beauty of
        nature and its miracles. In day-to-day life we often read about wonders of
        nature through books, magazines etc, but in fact we are unaware of mysterious
        nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trekking is a way by which it can be experienced, obviously it will be
        beneficial for us, because knowingly we destroy nature's beautiful places by
        throwing garbage here and there.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have to obey some rules to keep nature clean, that are learnt by trekking.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have experienced such trek… that was my first trek, through which first time
        I could communicate with nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        I was with my group including great trekkers as Kiran, Amey.
      </p>

      <p>
        We had gone on the fort of "Peth" nearer to "Karjat" station.
      </p>

      <p>
        We got a train at 5.41 a.m. from Dombivili which arrived at Karjat around
        6.45 a.m.
      </p>

      <p>
        From Karjat we came to Ambivili village by an auto, actually from this village
        real trekking starts.
      </p>

      <p>
        We started our trekking with great enthusiasm gossiping and chitchatting.
      </p>

      <p>
        I didn’t understand when we reached at the topmost part of fort.
      </p>

      <p>
        The way was full of grass and varieties of stones.
      </p>

      <p>
        We experienced many adventurous short cuts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Continuously for one and half hour we were climbing up.
      </p>

      <p>
        We climbed up at such a height that we could see we whole village.
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything was looking fresh and pretty.
      </p>

      <p>
        All tensions were going away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Touch of cool air flowing gave me courage.
      </p>

      <p>
        We took around to fort during which we experienced the thrill on walking narrow
        ways and enjoyed beautiful scene of varieties of plants and attractive
        flowers.
      </p>

      <p>
        At each and every moment I was very close to nature.
      </p>

      <p>
        At some places plastic bottles and papers were thrown, our group have fixed a
        board that gives message,
      </p>

      <p class="font-semibold text-center">
        "Save nature and your future."
      </p>

      <p>
        We started to climb down around 3.30 pm. and completed within one hour.
      </p>

      <p>
        We came to station, caught a train at 6.30 pm. and came to Dombivli around
        8.30pm.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thus a one-day trek gave me great courage, to do some more treks.
      </p>

      <p>
        I thank to my 'great group' forgiving me beautiful eyesight to look at nature.
      </p>
