        Karnala trek was totally different from normal treks, because there were
        rock-climbing and rappelling included on the thumb of Karnala.
      </p>

      <p>
        This was arranged by Yuva Trekkers Panvel and our friend Nilesh Kolte invited
        all of us to join them.
      </p>

      <p>
        Firstly, let me thank Nilesh for inviting us and giving us one of the most
        thrilling experiences we had in recent times.
      </p>

      <p>
        I had done small rock-climbing in the past but nothing as high as the thumb
        of Karnala, which is nearly 200 feet.
      </p>

      <p>
        Trek started from Dombivli where we caught the bus towards Panvel to join
        Nilesh and his group.
      </p>

      <p>
        Gaurav, Prajakta, Kaustubh, Harshad, Kedar, Sonali, Gayatri, Bhakti and many
        others including me were part of this trek.
      </p>

      <p>
        We were 16 and as usual our bus journey was full of Hindi and Marathi songs.
        Kaustubh amazed everyone with his singing.
      </p>

      <p>
        After reaching Panvel depot more members joined us and we reached Karnala
        base where we enjoyed special wada-pav.
      </p>

      <p>
        We started our trek towards the thumb of Karnala which took nearly two hours
        from base camp.
      </p>

      <p>
        At around 2.30 pm we were ready for rock-climbing when suddenly forest fire
        broke out around the thumb.
      </p>

      <p>
        The grass was burning fiercely and we had to rush everywhere to save our bags
        and prevent fire from reaching base camp.
      </p>

      <p>
        For nearly one and a half hours members of Yuva Trekkers and KshitiZ worked
        relentlessly to extinguish the fire.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thankfully the base camp was saved and the expedition resumed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rock-climbing and rappelling finally began and it was an unforgettable
        experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Yuva members guided us patiently on balance, weight transfer, safety
        measures and equipment usage.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even the girls participated fearlessly and enjoyed every moment.
      </p>

      <p>
        During rappelling, a huge rock slide occurred while I and Harshad were on the
        ropes.
      </p>

      <p>
        Harshad narrowly escaped serious injury and this incident taught us why
        following expert instructions is crucial.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reaching the top felt like being on top of the world.
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to delays caused by fire we returned via night trekking which turned out
        to be another thrilling experience.
      </p>

      <p>
        This trek taught me many important lessons about safety, preparation and
        teamwork.
      </p>

      <p>
        The experience and satisfaction are beyond words.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks to Nilesh and his group for making this one of the best treks I have
        ever done.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks to KshitiZ Parivar for unity and courage shown during the forest fire.
      </p>
